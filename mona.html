                        My name is Mona Azami, from Iran, moved to the Uk 2011.
                        I used to work as a graphic designer for around 10 years, I was happy with that. 
                        But when I heard about coding from a friend, I thought lets just have a look at that.
                        I had a look and still I am looking and looking at that. It is not easy to leave it.
                        I enjoy creating something simple but handy that makes the life easier. I started with <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTML5" >HTML5</a> and <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/css/">CSS3</a>.
                        And soon jumped to learn about <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/js/">vanilla Javascript</a>, then tried  new feutures<a href="https://www.w3schools.com/js/js_es6.asp">(ES6)</a> and also a deep undrestanding of JS. 
                        Just a quick look at <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/css/">database(SQL)</a> and backend development using <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/css/">NodeJS</a>. My favorite JavaScript library which is created by Facebook, is <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/css/">React</a>.
                        It's amazinly fast and efficient.Also It is easy to understand and less verbose than vanilla JS api.
